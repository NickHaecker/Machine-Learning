In particular, you will need to use the functions `ls_setup` and `lsh_search` and implement your own linear search. By linear search we mean comparing the query point $z$ directly with every database point $x$.The default parameters L = 10, k = 24 to `lsh_setup` work for this exercise.\n","* For each of the image patches in rows $100, 200, 300, . . . , 1000$, find the top 3 near neighbors (excluding the original patch itself) using both LSH and linear search.\n","What is the average search time for LSH?
